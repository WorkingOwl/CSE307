            In trying to understand the atom, physicists built quantum mechanics, the most successful theory in science
            and the basis of one-third of our economy. They found, to their embarrassment, that with their theory,
            physics encounters consciousness. Authors Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner explain all this in non-technical
            terms with help from some fanciful stories and anecdotes about the theory's developers. They present the
            quantum mystery honestly, emphasizing what is and what is not speculation. Quantum Enigma's description of
            the experimental quantum facts, and the quantum theory explaining them, is undisputed. Interpreting what it
            all means, however, is heatedly controversial. But every interpretation of quantum physics involves
            consciousness. Rosenblum and Kuttner therefore turn to exploring consciousness itself--and encounter quantum
            mechanics. Free will and anthropic principles become crucial issues, and the connection of consciousness
            with the cosmos suggested by some leading quantum cosmologists is mind-blowing. Readers are brought to a
            boundary where the particular expertise of physicists is no longer the only sure guide. They will find,
            instead, the facts and hints provided by quantum mechanics and the ability to speculate for themselves.
